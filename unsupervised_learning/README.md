<h1>Unsupervised Machine Learning</h1>
<p><i>Most of human and animal learning is unsupervised learning. If
intelligence was a cake, unsupervised learning would be the cake,
supervised learning would be the icing on the cake, and reinforcement
learning would be the cherry on the cake. We know how to make the
icing and the cherry, but we t know how to make the cake. We
need to solve the unsupervised learning problem before we can even
think of getting to true AI.</i><p>
