<h1>Regression Analysis</h1>
<p>I was able to cover regression problems and analysis, introduced myself to linear regression as well as multiple linear regression, gradient descent, and autoregression.</p>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Describe regression models and explain the difference between regression and classification problems
	</li>
	<li>Explain the concept of gradient descent, how it is used in linear regression problems, and how it can be applied to other model architectures</li>
	<li>Use linear regression to construct a linear model for data in an x-y plane</li>
	<li>Evaluate the performance of linear models and use the evaluation to choose the best	model</li>
	<li>Use feature engineering to create dummy variables for constructing more complicated linear models</li>
	<li>Construct time series regression models using autoregressio</li>
</ul>
