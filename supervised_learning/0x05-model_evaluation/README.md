<h1>Model Evaluation</h1>
<p>Here I learnt how to improve a model's performance by using hyperparameters and model evaluation metrics</p>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<p>These were my objectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Explain the importance of evaluating models</li>
	<li>Evaluate regression and classification models using a number of metrics</li>
	<li>Choose the right metric for evaluating and tuning a model</li>
	<li>Explain the importance of hold-out datasets and types of sampling</li>
	<li>Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best mode</li>
	<li>Calculate feature importance and explain why they are important</li>
</ul>
