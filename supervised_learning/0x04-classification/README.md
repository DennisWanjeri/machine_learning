<h1>Classification</h1>
<p>Here I tackled classification problems, using linear and logistic regression,
K-nearest neighbors classification, and decision trees.</p>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement logistic regression and explain how it can be used to classify data into specific groups or classes</li>
<li>Use the K-nearest neighbors clustering algorithm for classification</li>
<li>Use decision trees for data classification, including the ID3 algorithm</li>
<li>Describe the concept of entropy within data</li>
<li>Explain how decision trees such as ID3 aim to reduce entropy</li>
<li> Use decision trees for data classification</li>
</ul>
