<h1>Ensemble Modelling</h1>
<p>Here I covered bias and variance, and underfitting and overfitting, then dived into esemble modelling</p>
<h2>My Objectives were:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Explain the concepts of bias and variance and how they lead to underfitting and overfitting</li>
	<li>Explain the concepts behind bootstrapping</li>
	<li>Implement a bagging classifier using decision trees</li>
	<li>Implement adaptive boosting and gradient boosting models</li>
	<li>Implement a stacked ensemble using a number of classifiers</li>
</ul>
