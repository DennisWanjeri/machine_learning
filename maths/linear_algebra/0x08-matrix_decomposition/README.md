<h1>Matrix Decompositions</h1>
<p>Matrix decompositions are methods that reduce a matrix into constituent parts that make it easier to calculate more complex arithmetic computations</p>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Learn what a matrix decomposition is and why these types of operations are important</li>
	<li>How to calculate an LU and QR matrix decompositions in Python</li>
	<li>How to calculate a Cholesky matrix decomposition in python</li>
</ul>
<h1>Eigendecomposition</h1>
<p>Eigendecomposition decomposes a matrix into eigenvectors and eigenvalues</p>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>learn what eigendecomposition is and the role of eigenvectors and eigenvalues</li>
	<li>How to calculate eigendecomposition using Numpy</li>
	<li>How to confirm a vector is an eigenvector and how to reconstruct a matrix from eigenvectors and eigenvalues</li>
</ul>
<h1>Singular Value Decomposition</h1>
<p>is the most used decomposition method, all matrices have an SVD which makes it more stable</p>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Learn what Singular-value decomposition is and what is involved</li>
	<li>How to calculate an SVD and reconstruct a rectangular and square matrix from SVD elements</li>
	<li>How to calculate pseudoinverse and perform dimensionality reduction using the SVD</li>
</ul>
