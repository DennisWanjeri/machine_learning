<h1>matrix operations</h1>
<h2>Matrices and Matrix Arithmetic</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>learn what a matrix is and how to define one in Python</li>
	<li>How to perform element-wise operations such as addition, subtraction and Hadamard product</li>
	<li>How to multiply matrices together and intuition behind it </li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of matrices</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>learn Square, symmetric, triangular and diagonal matrices which are as much as their names suggest</li>
	<li>Identity matrices that are all zero values except along the main diagonal where the values are 1</li>
	<li>Orthogonal matrices that generalize the idea of perpendicular vectors and have useful computational properties</li>
</ul>
