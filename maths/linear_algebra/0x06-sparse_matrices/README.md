<h1>Sparse Matrices</h1>
<p>contain mostly zero values, non-zeros are called dense</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>

	<li>The myriads of areas where am likely to encounter sparse matrices in data, data preparation and sub-fields of machine learning</li>
	<li>The many efficient ways to store and work with sparse matrices</li>
</ul>
